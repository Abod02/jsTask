## Project Description
This project covers the following:
- Creating a Git repository.
- Cloning the repository and managing branches.
- Writing HTML and JavaScript to:

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to complete this project:
- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and logic for password validation.
- **Git**: For version control and branch management.
- **VS Code**: As the code editor.

## Steps to Complete
1. **Create and Clone the Repository**:
   - Create a new repository named `jsTask` on GitHub.
   - Clone the repository locally using the `gh repo clone` command.

2. **Branch Management**:
   - Create a new branch named `loops` using `git checkout -b loops`.

3. **File Creation**:
   - Create an `index.html` file for the webpage structure.
   - Create a `script.js` file for the JavaScript logic.

4. **Write Code**:
   - Add basic HTML tags in the `index.html` file.
   - Link the JavaScript file to the HTML file using the `<script>` tag.
   - Implement the following in `script.js`:
     - Prompt the user to enter their username and password.
     - Validate the password (`123` is the correct password).
     - Allow the user up to 5 attempts to enter the correct password.
     - Show alerts for successful login or failed attempts.

5. **Push Changes**:
   - Commit and push the changes to the `loops` branch.
   - Merge the `loops` branch into the `main` branch.
